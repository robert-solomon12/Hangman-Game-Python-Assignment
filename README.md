# Hangman-Game-Python-Assignment
The objective of this Project here is using the python program structure outlined in the lectures to create a hangman game for the user.

The program randomly selects a word from a list and tell the user how many letters are in the word they have to guess.



This project was completed for my Embedded Software Development Module.
